# hpccarpentry-mini-intro
material for our course on hpccarpentry.

There were max 16 people last week so we can probably expect the same. This would mean a max of 3 breakout rooms.

# Agenda
## What is HPC Carpentry? (20 mins, including discussion)
* Introduction to HPC Carpentry and what it's origins and goals are
* What HPC Carpentry is *not*
## (Inspired ideas from Peter go here)

## Lesson development for Centres of Excellence
FocusCoE has funded the creation of a template lesson on how to run a community code **at scale**. The idea being that such a lesson might be useful to CoEs who typically have a marquee scalable application. We chose LAMMPS as the test case because it is used heavily by the E-CAM community and development on top of LAMMPS is very common. 

### Overview of lesson design (20 minutes)
* What are the learner profiles?
* What are the objectives?
* What are the prerequisites?

### Breakout session - Review and critique (part of) an episode of the lesson (40 minutes, 30 + 10 for discussion after)
* Are the objectives of the episode clear
  * Are they reflected in the episode content
* Is the content clear
  * If there are metaphores, are they clear? Can you suggest improvements?
  * Are the examples clear? Can they be done in a reasonable amount of time? Are there potential pitfalls?
  * Is something missing? 

### How did we tackle lesson portability? (10 minutes)

Looking over the strategies we used to allow us to make the lessons portable between resources.
