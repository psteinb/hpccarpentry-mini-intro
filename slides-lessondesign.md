## Most common approach for lesson design

Most people design lessons like this (from [TeachTogether^]):

::: incremental

1. Someone asks you to teach something you barely know or haven’t thought about in years.

2. You start writing slides to explain what you know about the subject.

3. After 2 or 3 weeks, you make up an assignment based on what you’ve taught so far.

4. You repeat step 3 several times.

5. You stay awake into the wee hours of the morning to create a final exam and promise yourself that you’ll be more organized next time.

# before designing lessons 

## there is no coding gene

## learner profiles are/how to obtain them

## learning objectives

## prequisites
  
# lesson design 

## introduce constructive alignment (top-down)

## backwards design (bottom-up)
