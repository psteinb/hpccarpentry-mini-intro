## FocusCoE

* HPC CoE Coordination and Support Action
* One pillar is "Training"
  * Workshops (like this one on pedagogy)
  * Training registry
  * **Template training course(s)**
  
---

### Framework

::: incremental

- Use Carpentries lesson template
- Focus on application codes
  * Collaboration with E-CAM
- Address some cross-cutting topics (at a novice level)
  * Architecture
  * Performance
  * Scalability

:::

### Why LAMMPS?

- Large user community (and common in E-CAM)
- Architecture support
  - Different packages available
- Scalable
- Plugin support means many "added value" developers exist

---

### Design

* Half day
* Learner profiles:
  * Application **user**
  * Moving usage to HPC resources
* Prerequisites:
  * "Introduction to HPC", already LAMMPS user
* Objectives:
  * Verify performance of LAMMPS
  * Trigger hardware support
  * Check scalability, identify (and mitigate) bottlenecks
