for some the above is fear!

## Fear != Creativity

HPC should be a piece of [chalk](https://www.pexels.com/photo/child-in-green-shirt-and-black-shorts-sitting-on-ground-3679049/).

## So I sat down ...

```
commit 9a584e9fe0fa1009e0cc32228684ca1685038364
Author: steinbac <steinbac@mpi-cbg.de>
Date:   Tue Dec 6 09:58:31 2016 +0100

    added learning outline as a basis for discussion
```

from [psteinb/hpc-in-a-day](https://github.com/psteinb/hpc-in-a-day.git)

----

## What happened after

- 14 hpc-in-a-day workshops taught (about 10-15 attendance each)
- 4 contributions at conferences (2x CarpentryCon2018, 1x CarpentryCon2020, 1x ISC BoF Paper)
- helping to build a community ... [hpc-carpentry](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry?type=source)

Today!

# An HPC Carpentry Workshop

----

## [Target Audience(s)](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/why-hpc-carpentry)

- scientists or HPC users knowlededgeable in their (non-computational!) domain
- Priority is to get their work done, not necessarily to learn about computers
- Doesn’t know what large scale computing (Cloud? HPC? Grid?) is or why it can help them  
  (may think that programs will automatically run faster on a cluster)

----

## [Many Learners ...](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/why-hpc-carpentry)

- Haven’t used a shared system before
- Are not familiar with many of the terms (threads, cores) or concepts (scheduling) that are key to running on a shared batch system
- May have some command line or programming experience, but not necessarily
- may have only used GUIs in the past

----

## Communicate!

**Challenge**: Communicate who you want to address with a course!

(Yet Missing: Create Pre-Workshop Survey)

----

## Diversity of Learners!

## Lessons: Mix and Match

- [hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro) (very active repo)
- [hpc-carpentry/hpc-shell](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-shell) (some activity)
- [hpc-carpentry/hpc-python](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-python) (no activity)
- [hpc-carpentry/hpc-chapel](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-chapel) (legacy repo)

## Let's take a tour: [hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro)

::: notes

- Show basic navigation: landing page, episodes, instructors notes,...
- Finish with "Improve this page" to bring us back to talking about the edits/issues
- You can't iframe a GitHub repo so if you want to show the repo, you need to leave the slideshow

# Where can HPC Carpentry fit in?

::: notes

- HPC Carpentry is designed to be *scalable*
- It is oriented towards novices, it does not replace intermediate or advanced training

# A Way forward

----

## A Task Force ...

- to establish community processes
- monthly meeting calls
- implement lightweight, transparent and fair governance
- to sharpen and nourish the material
